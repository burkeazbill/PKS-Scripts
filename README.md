# VMware PKS scripts

VMware provides a variety of "PKS" products: VMware Enterprise PKS, VMware Cloud PKS, and VMware Essential PKS. This repo is my personal set of scripts written to work with these environments. 

## Purpose

The purpose of these scripts is to make things easier for me (and my team) when it comes to provisioning or cleaning up resources in our environments.

## Structure

As I write scripts, I'll place them in appropriately named folders here in this repo. My initial script is [cleanup-cloudpks-folder.sh](https://github.com/burkeazbill/PKS-Scripts/blob/master/CloudPKS/cleanup-cloudpks-folder.sh), found in the CloudPKS folder.
